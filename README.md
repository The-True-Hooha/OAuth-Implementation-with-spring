##Implementing OAuth with Spring Security

This is a demo project I built to further improve my understanding how OAuth works in authenticating the server/
resource client.

I'd recommend going through 
Baeldung's tutorial on [Spring Security OAuth authorization server](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-security-oauth-auth-server "tutorial")

Pardon the way this project was structured, the packages et al. If you need a guide, you can start a discussion,
and I'd be happy to go over the project with you.

Happy Learning!!
